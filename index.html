    Unmanned Autonomous Systems (UAS) represent an increasingly important
    convergence of robotics, artificial intelligence and communication technologies. 
    From driverless cars to military drones, these systems are redefining industries such as defence,
    agriculture and logistics with new impressive economical solutions.
    UAS are a relatively new category of technology which include some of the latest
    technological advancements in robotics, artificial intelligence,
    sensors and wireless communications. Which this article discusses along
    with its broad application in various sectors.
    Ethical and regulatory impediments do however hamper the potential for deployment of UAS.
    Most notably privacy and accountability. The potential of future UAS will be further
    increased by the advancements of quantum computing and renewable energy.
    To achieve there full potential regulatory and ethical concerns will need to be addressed.
